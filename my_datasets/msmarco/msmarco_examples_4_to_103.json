        "Since vitamin A is fat-soluble it is not needed in daily, large quantities. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body in organs such as the liver. Most of the vitamin A that we consume goes to the liver to be stored until it is needed by another part of the body. The vitamin A that we obtain from animal products is called retinoids and can be used by our bodies without any modification. The form of vitamin A found in fruits and vegetables is known as carotenoids. The most common type of carotenoid is-carotene (beta carotene).",
        "In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate, which is converted to retinol (chemically an alcohol) in the small intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods 1  : Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. 2  Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester",

        "Beta-carotene is a precursor for vitamin A. The body needs to convert it to retinol or vitamin A for use. Beta-carotene is found naturally in mostly orange and dark green plant foods, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, mangos, and kale. Vitamin A is a family of fat-soluble compounds that play an important role in vision, bone growth, reproduction, cell division, and cell differentiation. Vitamin A is important for healthy bones. However, too much vitamin A has been linked to bone loss and an increase in the risk of hip fracture.",
        "Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. Vitamin A is important for normal vision, the immune system, and reproduction. Vitamin A also helps the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs work properly. There are two different types of vitamin A. The first type, preformed vitamin A, is found in meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. The second type, provitamin A, is found in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based products. The most common type of provitamin A in foods and dietary supplements is beta-carotene",
        "Two forms of vitamin A are available in the human diet: preformed vitamin A (retinol and its esterified form, retinyl ester) and provitamin A carotenoids [ 1-5 ]. Preformed vitamin A is found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, fish, and meat (especially liver). By far the most important provitamin A carotenoid is beta-carotene; other provitamin A carotenoids are alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin. A portion of the vitamin A in some supplements is in the form of beta-carotene and the remainder is preformed vitamin A; others contain only preformed vitamin A or only beta-carotene. Supplement labels usually indicate the percentage of each form of the vitamin."

A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice.",
        "Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the Earth and they are formed through erosion or the gradual wearing down of the land by wind and water. In river valleys for example, the river acts as an erosional agent by grinding down the rock or soil and creating a valley. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo).",
        "A valley formed by flowing water, or river valley, is usually V-shaped. The exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it. Rivers with steep gradients, as in mountain ranges, produce steep walls and a bottom. Shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys. A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice.",
        "A glacier is a large body of ice that formed on land by the compaction and recrystallization of snow, survives year to year, and shows some sign of movement downhill due to gravity. The three main types of valleys are the V-shaped valley, the flat-floored valley, and the U-shaped valley. A V-shaped valley is a narrow valley that has a profile suggesting the form of the letter V, characterized by steeply sloping sides. It results from a stream eroding downward, a process referred to as downcutting.",
        "U shaped Valley-Yosemite. As a glacier moves downhill through a valley, the shape of the valley is transformed. A V-shaped valley is transformed into a U-shaped valley through the glacial erosion processes of plucking and abrasion. This results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier. A material called boulder clay is deposited on the floor of the valley. U-shaped valley in Leh valley, Ladakh, NW Indian Himalaya. The glacier visible at the head of the valley is the last remnants of the formerly much more extensive valley glacier which carved this valley.",
        "This is because they flowed down pre-existing river or V-shaped valleys during the last glaciation and caused the bottom of the V to level out into a U shape as the ice eroded the valley walls, resulting in a wider, deeper valley. For this reason, U-shaped valleys are sometimes referred to as glacial troughs. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo).",
        "A valley is a hollow or surface depression of the earth bounded by hills or mountains, a natural trough in the earth's surface, that slopes down to a stream, lake or the ocean, formed by water and/or ice erosion. Systems of valleys extend through plains, hills, and mountains. ",
        "Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the surface of the planet. They are carved by flowing water or flowing ice through the process of erosion, which is the gradual wearing away of Earth surfaces through the action of wind and water. A V-shaped valley is a narrow valley that has a profile suggesting the form of the letter V, characterized by steeply sloping sides. It results from a stream eroding downward, a process referred to as downcutting.",
        "Landforms of the upper valley-V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Landforms in upland regions are dominantly created by erosion processes, where land is worn away. Generally, the volume and discharge of rivers in upland regions tends to be low, and the river uses much of it's energy in overcoming friction. "

        "It also prepares your body for pregnancy each month. A cycle is counted from the first day of 1 period to the first day of the next period. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. Cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young teens. The rise and fall of levels of hormones during the month control the menstrual cycle",
        "For most women, the length of time between ovulation (when an egg is released from the ovary) and their monthly period is between 12 to 16 days (this is called the luteal phase). The first day of your menstrual cycle is the first day of your period (day 1). The period usually then lasts anything from 3 to 7 days. You’ll probably find that if you get any period pains, they’ll be at their worst in the first few days of your period. Your period",
        "The menstrual cycle is an average of 28 days, although it is normal to vary between 23 and 35 days. The cycle is counted from the first day of your period. Ovulation is the release of the egg from the ovary. This usually occurs at about day 14 of the cycle. Once released, the egg is fertile for up to 48 hours. If the egg is not fertilized, then the lining of the uterus will disintegrate, causing a period. By knowing your menstrual cycle, it is possible to approximate when you will be most fertile",
        "Ovulation is the release of a single, mature egg from a follicle that developed in the ovary. It usually occurs regularly, around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. Once released, the egg is capable of being fertilized for 12 to 48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. This is the most fertile period of your cycle: during ovulation your chances of conception are highest. The time of ovulation within the menstrual cycle is determined by the luteal phase, which is usually 12 to 16 days long. You can calculate the time of ovulation within your cycle by subtracting the length of your luteal phase from the length of your cycle. For example, if your cycle is 28 days long and your luteal phase is 12 days long, the ovulation will occur on day 16 of your cycle (28-12=16)",
        "Tracking Ovulation: A woman’s monthly cycle is measured from the first day of her menstrual period until the first day of her next period. On average, a woman’s cycle normally is between 28-32 days, but some women may have much shorter or much longer cycles. Ovulation can be calculated by starting with the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) or by calculating 12-16 days from the next expected period. The second half of the cycle is called the luteal phase and is from the day of ovulation until the next period begins. The luteal phase has a more precise timeline and usually is only 12-16 days from the day of ovulation. This ultimately means that the day of ovulation will determine how long your cycle is",
        "1 Work out the length of your average menstrual cycle. 2  Day one is the first day of the menstrual period and the last day is the day before the next period begins. 3  Ovulation happens about two weeks before the next expected period. 4  So if your average menstrual cycle is 28 days, you ovulate around day 14. 1 Day one is the first day of the menstrual period and the last day is the day before the next period begins. 2  Ovulation happens about two weeks before the next expected period. 3",
        "The day of ovulation differs from woman to woman and can even be different from month to month for an individual woman. For a woman with a 28 day cycle, the window of ovulation is day 11 through day 21 of your cycle. Ovulation could occur on any one day during this window.",
        "It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when ovulation happens, unless you're practising fertility awareness (FPA guide to natural family planning). However, ovulation usually happens 10-16 days before the start of a woman's next period. The menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of a woman’s period. This is day one. Some time after her period she will ovulate, then 10-16 days after this she will have her next period. "

Bulimia nervosa (bulimia) is characterized by repeatedly eating abnormally large amounts of food in a short period of time and then trying to compensate for the binge by purging (i.e., engaging in self-induced vomiting, using laxatives or diuretics), exercising excessively, or fasting. The average age of onset for bulimia is 18 years, but it occurs in children as young as 9 and adults into their mid-40s and older.

Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to attempts to rid oneself of the food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking a laxative. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm. Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition.

Males are affected by eating disorders at a rate one tenth of that of females. Bulimia nervosa is a common and treatable condition that often presents in the primary care setting. The hallmark sign for bulimia nervosa is a distorted view of food and eating. Patients with this condition often maintain a normal or above-normal weight.",

        "At 10 years after receiving treatment about 50% of people are fully recovered. Globally, bulimia was estimated to affect 6.5 million people in 2013. About 1% of young women have bulimia at a given point in time and about 2% to 3% of women have the condition at some point in their lives. The condition is less common in the developing world.

The lowest paid 10% of employed RN’s made less than $45,880 ($22.06 per hour), and the upper 10% percent made more than $98,880 ($47.54 per hour). The average salary for a RN working for an outpatient care center is $72,390 or $34.80 an hour. In local, private, and state hospitals, the average annual salary is roughly $71,640 ($34.44 per hour).

As an RN in Florida I can say that RN's starting salary is between $21-$24 per hour with an average of 1 dollar pay increases per hour per year, not to mention this is before taxes are taken out. RN's are in demand in Florida, but they are not as well compensated as is rumored. On average a RN makes from $38,000 to $70,000 per year. New grads in some areas such as NY can ma … ke $50,000 per year.... After you get a year or two under your belt in med surge, try traveling nursing.....you can make upwards of $80K to $90K per year...this assignments usually are 4 weeks to 12 weeks."

According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straight forward.

Consumer capitalism is a term that has been continually redefined since its introduction into popular culture in the 1920s as the public relations industry became ubiquitous, and used techniques derived from psychology and sociology to mass market consumer goods. For instance, the consumer may think he wants or needs a product, and as long as this desire is maintained, the value of the product will continue to rise. Consumer capitalism functions on the basic economic paradigm of supply and demand, but without regard to a product's intrinsic value.",

The Statue of Freedom that sits on top of the U.S. Capitol Building is an iconic part of the D.C. skyline.

She is a female allegorical figure whose right hand holds the hilt of a sheathed sword while a laurel wreath of victory and the Shield of the United States are clasped in her left hand. Crawford was commissioned to design Freedom in 1854 and executed the plaster model for the statue in his studio in Rome. Mississippian senator and U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (who would later become President of the Confederacy) was in charge of the Capitol construction and its decorations.",
        "The United States Capitol, often called Capitol Hill, is the seat of the United States Congress, the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government. It sits atop Capitol Hill, at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. . The Capitol has a long history in art of the United States, beginning in 1856 with Italian / Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi and his murals in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol.",
        "Though not at the geographic center of the Federal District, the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the District's four quadrants. The original building was completed in the year 1800 and was subsequently expanded, particularly with the addition of the massive dome. The Capitol has a long history in art of the United States, beginning in 1856 with Italian / Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi and his murals in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol.",
        "Reaching to a height of over 200 feet, the Capitol dome is topped by Daniel Chester French's elegant gilded bronze statue, Wisconsin.. Edwin Blashfield's mural Resources of Wisconsin lavishly decorates the ceiling of the rotunda, which is the only granite dome in the United States. ",
        "Sat-Sun & Holidays 8:00am - 4:00pm. The statue atop the state capitol building is named Wisconsin and was placed on the capitol dome as a symbol of the state's motto, Forward.. ",
        "Restoration of the statue and the pedestal was completed in approximately four months. The Statue of Freedom was returned to its pedestal by helicopter on October 23, 1993, amid the celebration of the bicentennial of the U.S. Capitol. Since then, every 2–3 years, the statue undergoes two weeks of cleaning and recoating as necessary. Crawford was commissioned to design Freedom in 1854 and executed the plaster model for the statue in his studio in Rome. Mississippian senator and U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (who would later become President of the Confederacy) was in charge of the Capitol construction and its decorations.",
        "In 1859 Thomas Crawford's plaster model for the Statue of Freedom, designed for the top of the dome, arrived from the sculptor's studio in Rome. With a height of 19 feet 6 inches, the statue was almost 3 feet taller than specified, and Walter was compelled to make revisions to his design for the dome. The statue is a classical female figure of Freedom wearing flowing draperies. Her right hand rests upon the hilt of a sheathed sword; her left holds a laurel wreath of victory and the shield of the United States with thirteen stripes."

        "Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Gold was formed in the sense of being placed on the earth when the earth was formed by cooling down from gas ejected by the Sun some 4.5 billion years ago. Gold deposits were laid down as rocks formed as part of that cooling process. The amount of gold in the earth has been constant since then. None has been made on earth, either naturally or by alchemists (who dreamed of turning lead into gold)."

Each time zone is then theoretically 15 degrees wide, corresponding to a one-hour difference in mean solar time. The shape of time zones is changed, in practice, to match internal and international borders.",
        "Best Answer: The concept of having a time zone comes from a basic desire to always have the local time correspond to the amount of daylight that is available. In short, most people tend to think of the middle of the day, or high noon, as being the time in which the sun is at the highest point in the sky. The reason there are different time zones and an International dateline is because there are different times. I suppose we could all go on GMT but that would mean that when it is 12:00 GMT it would be the middle of the night in Tokyo and early morning in New York.",
        "In order to build the time zone map, they studied Earth’s movements. As the Earth rotates on its axis, it moves about 15 degrees every 60 minutes. After 24 hours, it has completed a full circle rotation of 360 degrees. The scientists used this information to divide the planet into 24 sections or time zones. Each time zone is 15 degrees of longitude wide. If we had one single time zone for Earth, noon would be the middle of the day in some places, but it would be morning, evening and the middle of the night in others. Since different parts of the Earth enter and exit daylight at different times, we need different time zones",
        "Time zones are based on the fact that the Earth moves 15 degrees longitude each hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day there are 24 standard time zones. (24 hours x 15º=360º). Time zones are counted from the Prime Meridian (0º longitude). Each time zone is counted at 15 º intervals and extends 7½º either side of a central meridian. ",
        "Each time zone is 15 degrees of longitude wide (with local variations) and the local time is one hour earlier than the zone immediately to the east on the map. The number of standard time zones is debatable and discussed among various sources, particularly with regards to the International Date Line. How Time Zones Work. Each time zone is then theoretically 15 degrees wide, corresponding to a one-hour difference in mean solar time. The shape of time zones is changed, in practice, to match internal and international borders."

Its job is to store and supply the cell with needed energy. ATP is found in the cytoplasm of the cell.

Boccaccio's 100 stories are highly structured and may be metaphorically viewed as his gift of order on a disordered world. In these structured stories, Boccaccio celebrates two thematic ideas. The first theme is, as he writes in his dedication, is womanhood and love. The second theme is the intelligence of humankind.",
        "The Decameron (From the Greek: δέκα - ten & μέρα - day) (Italian: Decameron [deˈkaːmeron] or Decamerone [dekameˈroːne]), subtitled Prince Galehaut (Old Italian: Prencipe Galeotto [ˌprentʃipe ɡaleˈɔtto]), is a collection of novellas by the 14th-century Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375). Boccaccio probably conceived the Decameron after the epidemic of 1348, and completed it by 1353. The various tales of love in The Decameron range from the erotic to the tragic. Tales of wit, practical jokes, and life lessons contribute to the mosaic. In addition to its literary value and widespread influence (for example on Chaucer 's The Canterbury Tales), it provides a document of life at the time",
        "Dioneo narrates what is by far the most obscene and bawdy tale in the Decameron. Alibech, a naive young woman, wanders into the desert in an attempt to become closer to God. She happens upon the monk Rustico, and he deflowers her under the pretense of teaching her how to better please God. This tale is originally found in Hitopadesha, a Sanskrit collection of tales. Boccaccio, though, may have directly taken the tale from The Seven Wise Masters, which, although oriental in origin, was widely circulating in Latin at the time the Decameron was written.",
        "By invoking the name Prencipe Galeotto in the alternative title to Decameron, Boccaccio alludes to a sentiment he expresses in the text: his compassion for women deprived of free speech and social liberty, confined to their homes and, at times, lovesick. Boccaccio probably conceived the Decameron after the epidemic of 1348, and completed it by 1353. The various tales of love in The Decameron range from the erotic to the tragic. Tales of wit, practical jokes, and life lessons contribute to the mosaic. In addition to its literary value and widespread influence (for example on Chaucer 's The Canterbury Tales), it provides a document of life at the time",
        "The attention devoted to the tales of the Decameron among English poets of the Romantic period is indicative of a certain fundamental yet complex relationship between the aspirations and the themes of Boccaccio's text and those of the poetry of that revolutionary generation of writers. (It is interesting to note that Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem . The Garden of Boccaccio , a piece specifically about the spirit of Boccaccio and the Decameron, presents a perfect example of the mesh of naturalism and medievalism.",
        "In the last tale of the second day Dioneo begins his pattern of telling the last tale of the day, which he will continue until the end of the Decameron. The moral of the story – that a young woman should not marry an old man – is common in late medieval vernacular literature. This tale is originally found in Hitopadesha, a Sanskrit collection of tales. Boccaccio, though, may have directly taken the tale from The Seven Wise Masters, which, although oriental in origin, was widely circulating in Latin at the time the Decameron was written.",
        "a collection of a hundred tales, conceived of as rehearsed in ten days at a country-house during the plague at Florence; are of a licentious character, but exquisitely told; were written by Boccaccio; published in 1352; the name comes from deka, ten, and hemera, a day. ",
        "Therefore finding a central meaning to Boccaccio's The Decameron depends on understanding Boccaccio's thematic purpose. Boccaccio had witnessed in Florence the plague of the Black Death begun in 1347. Boccaccio's 100 stories are highly structured and may be metaphorically viewed as his gift of order on a disordered world. In these structured stories, Boccaccio celebrates two thematic ideas. The first theme is, as he writes in his dedication, is womanhood and love. The second theme is the intelligence of humankind.",

A three-dimensional object always rotates around an imaginary line called a rotation axis. If the axis passes through the body's center of mass, the body is said to rotate upon itself, or spin. Rotation around any axis can be performed by taking a rotation around the x axis, followed by a rotation around the y axis, and followed by a rotation around the z axis. That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.",

The most common use of the term rotation in math is in geometry. It is a form of translation, which is motion. Rotation refers to spinning about an axis point and is m … easured in degrees, up to 360. It is often coupled with reflection to describe the motion of the object.",
        "Rotation is how an object spins on its axis, like a planet, or a baseball or tennis ball with spin on it. Revolution is how an object revolves around another object, like the … Earth around the Sun or a tether ball around the pole. 18 people found this useful.

        "A rotation about an external point, e.g. the Earth about the Sun, is called a revolution or orbital revolution, typically when it is produced by gravity. Rotation around any axis can be performed by taking a rotation around the x axis, followed by a rotation around the y axis, and followed by a rotation around the z axis. That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.",
        "Full Definition of ROTATION. 1. a (1) : the action or process of rotating on or as if on an axis or center (2) : the act or an instance of rotating something b: one complete turn: the angular displacement required to return a rotating body or figure to its original orientation. 2. b: crop rotation. 3. ",
        "Rotation notation is usually denoted R(center, degrees).  1  Center  is the 'center of rotation.' This is the point around which you are performing your mathematical rotation.  2  Degrees  stands for how many degrees you should rotate. 3  A positive number usually by convention means counter clockwise. In math, a rotation lives up to its name! To rotate an object you need a center of rotation and how much you want to rotate it. By convention, positive rotations go counter clockwise, and negative rotations go",
        "Earth's rotation is the rotation of the planet Earth around its own axis. The Earth rotates from the west towards east. As viewed from North Star or polestar Polaris, the Earth turns counter-clockwise. The Earth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the sun and once every 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to the stars (see below). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past."

Labor costs are estimated between $182 to $231 while parts are priced between $72 to $130. Get a personalized estimate based on your location and specific car. Estimate does not include taxes and fees. The brake rotors should be inspected when the pads are replaced, and depending on their condition, they may need resurfacing or replacement. We recommend braking gently for the first 40 to 50 miles of driving on new pads. This will allow them to adjust to the rotors and help prevent squeaking.",
        "Replace or resurface the rotor if the rotor is the problem; or. Resurface the rotor on the hub using an on-car lathe. The main advantage of cutting rotors in place is that an on-car lathe cuts the rotor in the same plane that it rotates. This virtually eliminates runout and allows the rotor to run true. ",
        "Resurfacing the rotors is a quick-fix and cost-effective method to let your vehicle’s brakes function efficiently. When the brake pads are substituted for new ones, the rotors must be always measured to check if they still have adequate metal left to perform safe braking. 1 On average, the cost may vary depending on location, the mechanic/repair shop and kind of vehicle. 2  Most people pay anywhere from $250 to $375. 3  Each rotor can cost $30 to $55 each, depending on the mechanic.",

        "As inexpensive as many aftermarket rotors are today, it’s quite affordable to simply replace the rotors rather than resurface them. Some auto parts stores offer free resurfacing to customers who purchase pads, while others charge a nominal fee for resurfacing ($10 to $20 per rotor). New rotors should be ready to install right out of the box. There should be no need to “clean them up” with a shallow cut on a lathe",

        "That's actually a high pressure for something your system always supplies. It is within what a home well can be set at. You have a much wider range than city well water pressure. You can figure most city pressure to be around 30 psi. ",
        "Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: 50 - 70 psi would be a good level and 70 psi is on the verge of too much. That would be the short answer. You get more dynamic pressure when pipes reduce going into fixtures, but the water pressure stays the same. Best Answer: 50 - 70 psi would be a good level and 70 psi is on the verge of too much",
        "Ideally, the pressure should be set between 45 and 60 pounds in most residential plumbing systems.If the pressure rises too high particularly above 80 psi, plumbing fixtures and appliances (primarily water heaters) could be damaged or leak excessively. ",
        "This water pressure is often well over 100 psi, and too often over 150 psi. However, the maximum recommended pressure for a residence is 80 psi. You can easily test your water pressure with a gauge, such as the one pictured here, that screws on to a hose bibb. These are usually inexpensive (less than $10) at the home center. ",
        "Water pressure is the amount of force from the water main into your home. Water pressure is measured in pounds per square inch (PSI), and normal water pressure is typically between 30 and 80 PSI. Functional flow is the volume of water flowing through your pipes and arriving at individual fixtures. This is a bell-shaped device that reduces the water pressure. Aim for water pressure that is 60-70 PSI. If the house has low pressure, you first want to determine if the house is on a public water supply system or a private well system.",
        "Best Answer: There are a number of factors that come into play regarding actual water pressure in a home system. MOST residential plumbing systems are set up to run at no more than 40 psi.....I have personally tested cpvc plumbing to over 90 pounds with no leaks. Public water supply pressures vary according to the public system, but in our area, they tend to run about 30 psi. If you are on a private well, then your pressure will be determined by how your system is set up. If you have an 'in the well' pump, then you most likely have a bladder tank.",
        "You don’t want your home to have water pressure that is too low, but water pressure can also be too high. Piping systems are designed to have no more than 80 PSI. When you exceed this pressure it can cause problems. This is a bell-shaped device that reduces the water pressure. Aim for water pressure that is 60-70 PSI. If the house has low pressure, you first want to determine if the house is on a public water supply system or a private well system.",
        "http://www.homerepairtutor.com. Hi Friends, In this quick video I show you how to test your home's water pressure and share how to adjust water pressure down or up at the water pressure regulator. These tips come in handy when your home's water pressure becomes too high or low. You should also test to make sure your water pressure regulator is doing its job and this is the exact procedure to do that. I hope this video helps. ",
        "Normal Pressure Range. The normal range of water pressure in a residential application is between 40 psi and 80 psi. There is no specific rule about how much pressure is best for your house, since everyone's needs are different. However, anything below 40 psi will likely lead to poor performance of devices that use water. Anything higher than 80 psi could lead to damage, such as blown sprinkler heads or ruptured pipes"

        "Answer: You’ve got some breathing room. Ground beef that’s been defrosted in the fridge can be safely kept for an additional one to two days in the refrigerator before cooking, says the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And since you thawed the ground beef in the fridge, you can also safely refreeze it within that same timeframe, says the USDA. ",
        "A Ground beef should be used within two days of purchase. Be sure to check the use by information on the package label before purchase. You can store ground beef safely in your refrigerator at 35 to 40 degrees, for one to two days. If you can't use it within that time, freeze it. All fresh ground beef should be used within two days of purchase. • If fresh beef will not be used before the expiration date, place it tightly wrapped in your freezer on the bottom shelf. You can freeze beef in its original transparent wrap for up to two weeks.",

        "Beef. Beef in particular freezes well and will last quite a while without sacrificing flavor. Just how long it can be frozen depends on the individual cut and size of the beef. For example, roasts last the longest, up to 12 months when properly wrapped. Optimally, they should be used within six months. Stew and variety cuts are next on the list, lasting around 3 or 4 months",
        "Can I refrigerate or freeze leftover cooked hamburgers? How should they be reheated? If ground beef is refrigerated promptly after cooking (within 2 hours; 1 hour if the temperature is above 90 °F), it can be safely refrigerated for about 3 or 4 days. If frozen, it should keep its quality for about 4 months.",

        "1 How long does ground beef last in the fridge once it is cooked? 2  Cooked ground beef will usually stay good for 3 to 4 days in the fridge and 3 months in the freezer. 1 After ground beef is purchased, it may be refrigerated for 1 to 2 days — the sell-by date on the package may expire during that storage period, but the ground beef will remain safe to use after the sell by date if it has been properly stored.",
        "And with the use of a zip-seal bag and a permanent marker, you can avoid wasting your good food. Before you put meat in the freezer, you should always write the date on it -- that way you don't have to question how long it's been frozen. And, believe it or not, some meats can last in the freezer for up to one year. 1  Cooked poultry -- 4 months. 2  Uncooked poultry parts -- 9 months. 3  Uncooked whole poultry -- 12 months. ",

        "Teething usually begins around 6 months of age. But it is normal for teething to start at any time between 3 months and 12 months of age. By the time your child is about 3 years old, he or she will have all 20 primary teeth. The lower front teeth usually come in first. Upper front teeth usually come in 1 to 2 months after the lower front teeth. Here are some tips to help your baby feel better while teething: 1  Use a clean finger (or cold teething ring) to gently rub your baby's gum for about 2 minutes at a time. 2  Many babies find this soothing, although they may protest at first. 3  Provide safe objects for your baby to chew on, such as teething rings.",

An early developer may get his first white cap as early as 3 months, while a late bloomer may have to wait until he's a year old or more. Some babies get through teething with no problems at all, but many parents report that their babies do experience discomfort. The symptoms most likely to trouble a teether include: 1  Irritability or fussiness. 2  Drooling (which can lead to a facial rash). 3  Gum swelling and sensitivity. 4  Gnawing or chewing behavior.",

        "By age 3, your child should have a full set of 20 baby teeth, and they shouldn't start to fall out until his permanent teeth are ready to start coming in – around age 6.

The symptoms most likely to trouble a teether include: 1  Irritability or fussiness. 2  Drooling (which can lead to a facial rash). 3  Gum swelling and sensitivity. 4  Gnawing or chewing behavior.",
        "However, all babies are different and the timing of teething varies. Some babies are born with their first teeth. Others start teething before they are four months old, and some after 12 months. Early teething should not cause a child any problems, unless it affects their feeding. A rough guide to the different stages of teething is:",
        "4 9 months babies usually start drooling and putting fingers in mouth by 4 months sometimes they can show all symptoms of teething a good 2 months before you see the tooth pop through it is ok if you see no tooth even at 9 months as long as the baby is growing fine and is not completely bald very variable while most infants start between 4 8 months old it is perfectly normal to start younger or later while rare some children do not start teething until 12 months of age children who get their baby teeth late will often get their permanent teeth later as well",
        "Most babies get their first tooth at around 6 months, but your child's chompers may appear as early as 3 months or as late as 14, depending on such factors as when Mom and Dad started sprouting teeth and whether or not your baby was a preemie (preemies tend to teethe on the late side). "

Often this cancer appears as a raised bump that looks smooth and pearly. Another type looks like a scar and is flat and firm and may be white, yellow, or waxy. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs on areas of the skin that have been in the sun, such as the ears, lower lip, and the back of the hands.

In general, a low platelet count occurs because: 1  The body's bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets. 2  The bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up. 3  The spleen holds on to too many platelets",
        "A low platelet count is often assumed to be ITP (immune thrombocytopenia). However, there are many other possible causes of thrombocytopenia, with clinical severity ranging from trivial to life threatening. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. It can only be diagnosed after all other causes of low platelets are ruled out. When thrombocytopenia is severe (a platelet count less than 20-30,000/microliter), and other obvious causes are ruled out, many doctors administer the first-line treatments for ITP: prednisone, anti-D, IVIG. A rapid response to these therapies supports the diagnosis of ITP.",
        "Many people who have large platelets also have a reduced platelet count. The platelet size can be genetic, as seen in people with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, gray platelet syndrome, and May-Hegglin anomaly. In other cases, it may occur in response to problems in the bone marrow, such as cancers that disrupt the production of blood cells. The most common problem experienced by people with large platelets is increased bleeding.",
        "Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/mm 3. With normal platelet function, thrombocytopenia is rarely the cause of bleeding unless the count is less than 50,000/mm 3. Thrombocytopenia should always be confirmed by examination of a peripheral smear. ",

        "The DML documentation, however, does not include the TRUNCATE TABLE statement, although the statement, like DELETE, also lets you delete data from a SQL Server table. Of all the DML statements, the DELETE statement is probably the easiest to use. ",

TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to the DELETE statement with no WHERE clause; however, TRUNCATE TABLE is faster and uses fewer system and transaction log resources. Applies to: SQL Server (SQL Server 2008 through current version), Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse Public Preview. Less transaction log space is used. The DELETE statement removes rows one at a time and records an entry in the transaction log for each deleted row. TRUNCATE TABLE removes the data by deallocating the data pages used to store the table data and records only the page deallocations in the transaction log.",
        "DML on both table variables and temp tables writes to the tempdb transaction log. Whether or not it is worth switching to TRUNCATE rather than DELETE depends on the size of data involved.

To remove the table definition in addition to its data, use the DROP TABLE statement. Less transaction log space is used.

If you omit schema, then Oracle Database assumes the table is in your own cluster. You can truncate index-organized tables and temporary tables. When you truncate a temporary table, only the rows created during the current session are removed. Oracle Database changes the NEXT storage parameter of table to be the size of the last extent deleted from the segment in the process of truncation. Restrictions on Truncating Tables This statement is subject to the following restrictions: You cannot individually truncate a table that is part of a cluster. You must either truncate the cluster, delete all rows from the table, or drop and re-create the table.",

        "Thanks for the clarification. You are looking for truncate table to work with table variables. This is currently not supported. Table variables in general use less logging and the perf difference between delete and truncate may not be that significant unless lots of rows are involved.

        "Sure, fiber supplements are a convenient way to increase your daily fiber intake. But what you may not have realized is that not all fibers are the same. Metamucil® is the only leading fiber supplement brand with 100% natural psyllium fiber — and that makes all the difference. Psyllium husk, a natural dietary fiber originating from plantago ovata, has been the source of both soluble and insoluble fiber in Metamucil for 80 years. Studies suggest that the psyllium in Metamucil works differently. The psyllium fiber in Metamucil forms a viscous gel that traps some bile acids (made from cholesterol) and gently removes them from your body. This gel also traps some carbohydrates and sugars, allowing them to be more slowly absorbed by the body. ",
        "Psyllium is a form of fiber made from the Plantago ovata plant, specifically from the husks of the plant’s seed. It sometimes goes by the name ispaghula. It’s most commonly known as a laxative. Psyllium provides more benefits to your body than decreasing the amount of time you spend in the bathroom. Numerous studies have shown that fiber like psyllium, as part of a healthy diet, can help lower a person’s risk of heart disease. Psyllium can affect your heart by lowering blood pressure, improving lipid levels, and strengthening heart muscle.",
        "The soluble fiber found in psyllium husks can help lower cholesterol. Psyllium can help relieve both constipation and diarrhea, and is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, hemorrhoids, and other intestinal problems. Psyllium has also been used to help regulate blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Overview. Psyllium is a soluble fiber used primarily as a gentle bulk-forming laxative in products such as Metamucil. It comes from a shrub-like herb called Plantago ovata that grows worldwide but is most common in India. Each plant can produce up to 15,000 tiny, gel-coated seeds, from which psyllium husk is derived",
        "The generic name for this fiber is psyllium. The fiber absorbs liquid in the intestines and swells and forms a bulky stool, which is easy to pass. The active ingredients are the seed husks of the psyllium plant. The Metamucil brand has been in existence since 1934. It was owned by G. D. Searle & Company until 1985 when Proctor & Gamble bought the brand.",

Psyllium seed husks, also known as ispaghula, isabgol, or psyllium, are portions of the seeds of the plant Plantago ovata, (genus Plantago), a native of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

        "Psyllium fiber comes from the outer coating, or husk of the psyllium plant's seeds. It is not wheat, and is therefore gluten free. The psyllium husk is a natural source of soluble fiber, similar to fiber found in grains such as oats and barley. *The amount of soluble fiber in psyllium is nearly 5X higher than that of oat bran. 100 grams of psyllium = 50 grams of soluble fiber. 100 grams of oat bran = 5 grams of soluble fiber.

        "Why would a peripheral nerve block of the foot be performed? A peripheral nerve block of the foot may be performed if you are experiencing pain, numbness, and/or tingling in your foot area. This block may be performed in a series of up to five (5) blocks in a row depending on your condition.",
        "A nerve block is an anesthetic or anti-inflammatory injection targeted toward a certain nerve or group of nerves to treat pain. The purpose of the injection is to turn off a pain signal coming from a specific location in the body or to decrease inflammation in that area.",
        "A. A. Nerve blocks are used for pain treatment and management. Often a group of nerves, called a plexus or ganglion, that causes pain to a specific organ or body region can be blocked with the injection of medication into a specific area of the body. The injection of this nerve-numbing substance is called a nerve block.",
        "A nerve block is the injection of numbing medication (local anesthetic) near specific nerves to decrease your pain in a certain part of your body during and after surgery.",
        "A peripheral nerve block of the foot is an injection of a small amount of local anesthetic and steroid to block one or more of the nerves that supply feeling to the foot.",
        "Nerve blocks are used to treat chronic pain when drugs or other treatments do not control pain or cause bad side effects. A test block is usually performed with local anesthetic. If you achieve good pain relief from the local anesthetic, your doctor may inject a nerve block, such as alcohol or phenol."
