        "On an average day, forensic chemists apply knowledge from diverse disciplines such as chemistry, biology, materials science, and genetics to analyze evidence found at crime scenes or in the bodies of crime suspects.

        "Some forensic scientists perform a wide array of lab work. Other forensic scientists specialize in certain aspects of crimes. There are a couple of required skills that all forensic scientists need. A forensic scientist must have good communication skills for writing reports that will be read by other scientists and laymen. Many of these scientists are called on to give expert witness testimony or present evidence in court and need good public speaking skills.",
        "Forensic science technicians typically need at least a bachelor’s degree in a natural science, such as chemistry or biology, or in forensic science. On-the-job training is usually required both for those who investigate crime scenes and for those who work in labs."

Those seen hunting during the day are probably starving. Q: Where do the owls go to hunt at night? A: In most cases, these birds travel 1 to 2 miles from the daytime roost site to hunt. They hunt in roadside ditches, grassy fields, meadows, and swampy areas away from buildings. Q: How many voles does an owlet eat each night?

        "Lightning is a major cause of storm related deaths in the U.S. A lightning strike can result in a cardiac arrest (heart stopping) at the time of the injury, although some victims may appear to have a delayed death a few days later if they are resuscitated but have suffered irreversible brain damage.",
        "Quick Answer. Lightning strikes reach the ground on Earth as much as 8 million times per day or 100 times per second, according to the National Severe Storms Laboratory. Out of all the lightning strikes in the world, the United States accounts for about 20 million of the total number of lightning strikes each year. Keep Learning.",
        "An average lightning strike discharges about 30,000 amperes (20,000 amperes in the UK). The current in a lightning strike typically ranges from 5,000 to 50,000 amperes depending on the strength of storm. NASA has recorded strikes of 100,000 amperes and there are other reports of strikes over 200,000 amperes.",
        "Lightning fatalities in the U.S.: A map of total lightning fatalities in the United States between 1959 and 2013. With 471 deaths, Florida has more than double the number of fatalities of any other state.",
        "Lightning is a sudden high-voltage discharge of electricity that occurs within a cloud, between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground. Globally, there are about 40 to 50 flashes of lightning every second, or nearly 1.4 billion flashes per year.",
        "Although many lightning flashes are simply cloud-to-cloud, there are as many as 9,000,000 reported lightning strikes that damage buildings, trees, and other objects every year. Worldwide, it is estimated that of an annual 1.4 billion lightning bolts, 25% (more than 350 million) will strike the Earth's surface or objects on the surface. The vast majority of these strikes, however, occur in the tropics, and in unpopulated areas. 100 times per second; Lightning can strike over a thousand times in one storm. So, lightning strikes the earth over a million times a day. Globally, 8,640,000 lightning strikes per day.",
        "According to the NWS Storm Data, over the last 30 years (1986-2015) the U.S. has averaged 48 reported lightning fatalities per year. Only about 10% of people who are struck by lightning are killed, leaving 90% with various degrees of disability. More recently, in the last 10 years (2006-2015), the U.S. has averaged 31 lightning fatalities.",
        "Approximately 300,000 lightning strikes hit the ground in Britain each year with 30 percent of reported lightning strikes causing severe damage. Each year 30 to 60 people are recorded as being struck by lightning, 3 of whom, on average, die (14 in 1984 compared to 2 in 2005).",
        "Florida is also the state with the highest number of deaths from lightning strikes. Other states along the Gulf of Mexico coast, such as Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, also have frequent lightning. Along the Atlantic coast, North Carolina and South Carolina have frequent lightning.",
        "There is estimated to be around 2,000 lightning storm active around the global at one time creating over 100 strikes per second. These thunderstorms generate a potential difference of 200,000 to 500,000 volts between the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere, with a fair weather current of about 2×10-12 amperes/meter2."

        "Verify the reason for the lawn burn. Grass will turn yellow due to an over application of high nitrogen fertilizer. The lawn will also turn yellow when it goes dormant in the fall. Rake the lawn to remove as much dead grass as possible. Remove several inches of soil if the herbicide was not a high nitrogen type.",
        "These spots are generally caused by a buildup of nitrogen in the soil. Although nitrogen is required to make the lawn green, a lawn burn is a case of too much of a good thing. The nitrogen buildup may be caused by over-fertilizing your lawn, or it may be caused by urine deposits left by pets. No matter what the source of nitrogen burn marks, fixing the discolored lawn is relatively easy.",
        "Position the sprinkler over the portion of overfertilized lawn. Turn on the sprinkler and allow it to run until the soil below the grass becomes fully saturated. Allow the water to drain down through the soil, carrying the excess fertilizer with it. Apply 1 inch of water per day for the next seven days.",
        "When fertilizing start with a dry lawn. Using either a broadcast or drop spreader, apply one-half of the recommended amount in one direction then spread the remaining half at right angles to the first. After fertilizing, it is necessary to water your lawn to wash the material off the grass and into the soil.",
        "Fertilizing Tips. Watering and mowing alone will not make a healthy lawn. It must be fertilized. We have included a starter fertilizer in the mixture applied, but it is only sufficient to supply enough nutrients for about 30 to 45 days. It is important for the development of a healthy lawn that a fertilization program be started at this time.",
        "A yellow burned lawn is an eye sore that can only be fixed by reseeding all affected areas. The process of reseeding is time consuming but will be worth it once the lawn is in full vigor. The entire lawn does not have to be replaced if the burn is isolated to small areas. Simply remove only the damaged lawn and reseed.",
        "Grass1950, the amount of fertilizer you would lose to outgassing in dry conditions is very small. If you don't water, the dew that forms overnight will dissolve some of the fertilizer and increase your chances for burn, especially with the amount the OP put down. I hope everything thing turns out OK for the OP, but to lessen the odds of damaging her lawn it would be much better to water in what was put down.",
        "Rake up the dead grass blades in the fertilizer-burned areas. Remove the top 2 to 3 inches of soil in the cleared area with a shovel. Place the dead grass and soil in a wheelbarrow. Transport the removed material to a compost pile or trash bin and discard it.",
        "Fertilizer burn is the result of over fertilizing plants or applying fertilizer to wet foliage. Fertilizer contains salts, which draw moisture out of plants. When you apply excess fertilizer to plants, the result is yellow or brown discoloration and root damage.",
        "Preventing Fertilizer Burn. The good news is that fertilizer burn can be prevented. Here are some tips on preventing fertilizer burn on plants: Fertilize each plant according to its needs. You won’t get better results when you use more fertilizer and you run the risk of damaging or killing your plants."

However, on the average, a raindrop is between 0.1 to 5 millimeters. There are some exceptions; rarely, raindrops of 8 millimeters were known to occur. Sizes larger than that do not normally occur because the raindrop particles simply break up or collide with other neighboring particles.",
        "By suspending drops of known size, he determined that small drops up to about 2 mm (0.08 inches) in diameter fell as spheres. Larger drops, however, deformed while falling acquiring a shape with a flat bottom and rounded top similar to that of a hamburger bun."
