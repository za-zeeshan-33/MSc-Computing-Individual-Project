        "Since vitamin A is fat-soluble it is not needed in daily, large quantities. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body in organs such as the liver. Most of the vitamin A that we consume goes to the liver to be stored until it is needed by another part of the body. The vitamin A that we obtain from animal products is called retinoids and can be used by our bodies without any modification. The form of vitamin A found in fruits and vegetables is known as carotenoids. The most common type of carotenoid is-carotene (beta carotene).",
        "In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate, which is converted to retinol (chemically an alcohol) in the small intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods 1  : Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. 2  Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester",

        "Beta-carotene is a precursor for vitamin A. The body needs to convert it to retinol or vitamin A for use. Beta-carotene is found naturally in mostly orange and dark green plant foods, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, mangos, and kale. Vitamin A is a family of fat-soluble compounds that play an important role in vision, bone growth, reproduction, cell division, and cell differentiation. Vitamin A is important for healthy bones. However, too much vitamin A has been linked to bone loss and an increase in the risk of hip fracture.",
        "Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. Vitamin A is important for normal vision, the immune system, and reproduction. Vitamin A also helps the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs work properly. There are two different types of vitamin A. The first type, preformed vitamin A, is found in meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. The second type, provitamin A, is found in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based products. The most common type of provitamin A in foods and dietary supplements is beta-carotene",
        "Two forms of vitamin A are available in the human diet: preformed vitamin A (retinol and its esterified form, retinyl ester) and provitamin A carotenoids [ 1-5 ]. Preformed vitamin A is found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, fish, and meat (especially liver). By far the most important provitamin A carotenoid is beta-carotene; other provitamin A carotenoids are alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin. A portion of the vitamin A in some supplements is in the form of beta-carotene and the remainder is preformed vitamin A; others contain only preformed vitamin A or only beta-carotene. Supplement labels usually indicate the percentage of each form of the vitamin."

A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice.",
        "Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the Earth and they are formed through erosion or the gradual wearing down of the land by wind and water. In river valleys for example, the river acts as an erosional agent by grinding down the rock or soil and creating a valley. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo).",
        "A valley formed by flowing water, or river valley, is usually V-shaped. The exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it. Rivers with steep gradients, as in mountain ranges, produce steep walls and a bottom. Shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys. A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice.",
        "A glacier is a large body of ice that formed on land by the compaction and recrystallization of snow, survives year to year, and shows some sign of movement downhill due to gravity. The three main types of valleys are the V-shaped valley, the flat-floored valley, and the U-shaped valley. A V-shaped valley is a narrow valley that has a profile suggesting the form of the letter V, characterized by steeply sloping sides. It results from a stream eroding downward, a process referred to as downcutting.",
        "U shaped Valley-Yosemite. As a glacier moves downhill through a valley, the shape of the valley is transformed. A V-shaped valley is transformed into a U-shaped valley through the glacial erosion processes of plucking and abrasion. This results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier. A material called boulder clay is deposited on the floor of the valley. U-shaped valley in Leh valley, Ladakh, NW Indian Himalaya. The glacier visible at the head of the valley is the last remnants of the formerly much more extensive valley glacier which carved this valley.",
        "This is because they flowed down pre-existing river or V-shaped valleys during the last glaciation and caused the bottom of the V to level out into a U shape as the ice eroded the valley walls, resulting in a wider, deeper valley. For this reason, U-shaped valleys are sometimes referred to as glacial troughs. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo).",
        "A valley is a hollow or surface depression of the earth bounded by hills or mountains, a natural trough in the earth's surface, that slopes down to a stream, lake or the ocean, formed by water and/or ice erosion. Systems of valleys extend through plains, hills, and mountains. ",
        "Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the surface of the planet. They are carved by flowing water or flowing ice through the process of erosion, which is the gradual wearing away of Earth surfaces through the action of wind and water. A V-shaped valley is a narrow valley that has a profile suggesting the form of the letter V, characterized by steeply sloping sides. It results from a stream eroding downward, a process referred to as downcutting.",
        "Landforms of the upper valley-V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Landforms in upland regions are dominantly created by erosion processes, where land is worn away. Generally, the volume and discharge of rivers in upland regions tends to be low, and the river uses much of it's energy in overcoming friction. "

        "It also prepares your body for pregnancy each month. A cycle is counted from the first day of 1 period to the first day of the next period. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. Cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young teens. The rise and fall of levels of hormones during the month control the menstrual cycle",
        "For most women, the length of time between ovulation (when an egg is released from the ovary) and their monthly period is between 12 to 16 days (this is called the luteal phase). The first day of your menstrual cycle is the first day of your period (day 1). The period usually then lasts anything from 3 to 7 days. You’ll probably find that if you get any period pains, they’ll be at their worst in the first few days of your period. Your period",
        "The menstrual cycle is an average of 28 days, although it is normal to vary between 23 and 35 days. The cycle is counted from the first day of your period. Ovulation is the release of the egg from the ovary. This usually occurs at about day 14 of the cycle. Once released, the egg is fertile for up to 48 hours. If the egg is not fertilized, then the lining of the uterus will disintegrate, causing a period. By knowing your menstrual cycle, it is possible to approximate when you will be most fertile",
        "Ovulation is the release of a single, mature egg from a follicle that developed in the ovary. It usually occurs regularly, around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. Once released, the egg is capable of being fertilized for 12 to 48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. This is the most fertile period of your cycle: during ovulation your chances of conception are highest. The time of ovulation within the menstrual cycle is determined by the luteal phase, which is usually 12 to 16 days long. You can calculate the time of ovulation within your cycle by subtracting the length of your luteal phase from the length of your cycle. For example, if your cycle is 28 days long and your luteal phase is 12 days long, the ovulation will occur on day 16 of your cycle (28-12=16)",
        "Tracking Ovulation: A woman’s monthly cycle is measured from the first day of her menstrual period until the first day of her next period. On average, a woman’s cycle normally is between 28-32 days, but some women may have much shorter or much longer cycles. Ovulation can be calculated by starting with the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) or by calculating 12-16 days from the next expected period. The second half of the cycle is called the luteal phase and is from the day of ovulation until the next period begins. The luteal phase has a more precise timeline and usually is only 12-16 days from the day of ovulation. This ultimately means that the day of ovulation will determine how long your cycle is",
        "1 Work out the length of your average menstrual cycle. 2  Day one is the first day of the menstrual period and the last day is the day before the next period begins. 3  Ovulation happens about two weeks before the next expected period. 4  So if your average menstrual cycle is 28 days, you ovulate around day 14. 1 Day one is the first day of the menstrual period and the last day is the day before the next period begins. 2  Ovulation happens about two weeks before the next expected period. 3",
        "The day of ovulation differs from woman to woman and can even be different from month to month for an individual woman. For a woman with a 28 day cycle, the window of ovulation is day 11 through day 21 of your cycle. Ovulation could occur on any one day during this window.",
        "It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when ovulation happens, unless you're practising fertility awareness (FPA guide to natural family planning). However, ovulation usually happens 10-16 days before the start of a woman's next period. The menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of a woman’s period. This is day one. Some time after her period she will ovulate, then 10-16 days after this she will have her next period. "

Bulimia nervosa (bulimia) is characterized by repeatedly eating abnormally large amounts of food in a short period of time and then trying to compensate for the binge by purging (i.e., engaging in self-induced vomiting, using laxatives or diuretics), exercising excessively, or fasting. The average age of onset for bulimia is 18 years, but it occurs in children as young as 9 and adults into their mid-40s and older.

Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to attempts to rid oneself of the food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking a laxative. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm. Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition.

Males are affected by eating disorders at a rate one tenth of that of females. Bulimia nervosa is a common and treatable condition that often presents in the primary care setting. The hallmark sign for bulimia nervosa is a distorted view of food and eating. Patients with this condition often maintain a normal or above-normal weight.",

        "At 10 years after receiving treatment about 50% of people are fully recovered. Globally, bulimia was estimated to affect 6.5 million people in 2013. About 1% of young women have bulimia at a given point in time and about 2% to 3% of women have the condition at some point in their lives. The condition is less common in the developing world.

The lowest paid 10% of employed RN’s made less than $45,880 ($22.06 per hour), and the upper 10% percent made more than $98,880 ($47.54 per hour). The average salary for a RN working for an outpatient care center is $72,390 or $34.80 an hour. In local, private, and state hospitals, the average annual salary is roughly $71,640 ($34.44 per hour).

As an RN in Florida I can say that RN's starting salary is between $21-$24 per hour with an average of 1 dollar pay increases per hour per year, not to mention this is before taxes are taken out. RN's are in demand in Florida, but they are not as well compensated as is rumored. On average a RN makes from $38,000 to $70,000 per year. New grads in some areas such as NY can ma … ke $50,000 per year.... After you get a year or two under your belt in med surge, try traveling nursing.....you can make upwards of $80K to $90K per year...this assignments usually are 4 weeks to 12 weeks."

According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straight forward.

Consumer capitalism is a term that has been continually redefined since its introduction into popular culture in the 1920s as the public relations industry became ubiquitous, and used techniques derived from psychology and sociology to mass market consumer goods. For instance, the consumer may think he wants or needs a product, and as long as this desire is maintained, the value of the product will continue to rise. Consumer capitalism functions on the basic economic paradigm of supply and demand, but without regard to a product's intrinsic value.",

The Statue of Freedom that sits on top of the U.S. Capitol Building is an iconic part of the D.C. skyline.

She is a female allegorical figure whose right hand holds the hilt of a sheathed sword while a laurel wreath of victory and the Shield of the United States are clasped in her left hand. Crawford was commissioned to design Freedom in 1854 and executed the plaster model for the statue in his studio in Rome. Mississippian senator and U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (who would later become President of the Confederacy) was in charge of the Capitol construction and its decorations.",
        "The United States Capitol, often called Capitol Hill, is the seat of the United States Congress, the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government. It sits atop Capitol Hill, at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. . The Capitol has a long history in art of the United States, beginning in 1856 with Italian / Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi and his murals in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol.",
        "Though not at the geographic center of the Federal District, the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the District's four quadrants. The original building was completed in the year 1800 and was subsequently expanded, particularly with the addition of the massive dome. The Capitol has a long history in art of the United States, beginning in 1856 with Italian / Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi and his murals in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol.",
        "Reaching to a height of over 200 feet, the Capitol dome is topped by Daniel Chester French's elegant gilded bronze statue, Wisconsin.. Edwin Blashfield's mural Resources of Wisconsin lavishly decorates the ceiling of the rotunda, which is the only granite dome in the United States. ",
        "Sat-Sun & Holidays 8:00am - 4:00pm. The statue atop the state capitol building is named Wisconsin and was placed on the capitol dome as a symbol of the state's motto, Forward.. ",
        "Restoration of the statue and the pedestal was completed in approximately four months. The Statue of Freedom was returned to its pedestal by helicopter on October 23, 1993, amid the celebration of the bicentennial of the U.S. Capitol. Since then, every 2–3 years, the statue undergoes two weeks of cleaning and recoating as necessary. Crawford was commissioned to design Freedom in 1854 and executed the plaster model for the statue in his studio in Rome. Mississippian senator and U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (who would later become President of the Confederacy) was in charge of the Capitol construction and its decorations.",
        "In 1859 Thomas Crawford's plaster model for the Statue of Freedom, designed for the top of the dome, arrived from the sculptor's studio in Rome. With a height of 19 feet 6 inches, the statue was almost 3 feet taller than specified, and Walter was compelled to make revisions to his design for the dome. The statue is a classical female figure of Freedom wearing flowing draperies. Her right hand rests upon the hilt of a sheathed sword; her left holds a laurel wreath of victory and the shield of the United States with thirteen stripes."

        "Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Gold was formed in the sense of being placed on the earth when the earth was formed by cooling down from gas ejected by the Sun some 4.5 billion years ago. Gold deposits were laid down as rocks formed as part of that cooling process. The amount of gold in the earth has been constant since then. None has been made on earth, either naturally or by alchemists (who dreamed of turning lead into gold)."

Each time zone is then theoretically 15 degrees wide, corresponding to a one-hour difference in mean solar time. The shape of time zones is changed, in practice, to match internal and international borders.",
        "Best Answer: The concept of having a time zone comes from a basic desire to always have the local time correspond to the amount of daylight that is available. In short, most people tend to think of the middle of the day, or high noon, as being the time in which the sun is at the highest point in the sky. The reason there are different time zones and an International dateline is because there are different times. I suppose we could all go on GMT but that would mean that when it is 12:00 GMT it would be the middle of the night in Tokyo and early morning in New York.",
        "In order to build the time zone map, they studied Earth’s movements. As the Earth rotates on its axis, it moves about 15 degrees every 60 minutes. After 24 hours, it has completed a full circle rotation of 360 degrees. The scientists used this information to divide the planet into 24 sections or time zones. Each time zone is 15 degrees of longitude wide. If we had one single time zone for Earth, noon would be the middle of the day in some places, but it would be morning, evening and the middle of the night in others. Since different parts of the Earth enter and exit daylight at different times, we need different time zones",
        "Time zones are based on the fact that the Earth moves 15 degrees longitude each hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day there are 24 standard time zones. (24 hours x 15º=360º). Time zones are counted from the Prime Meridian (0º longitude). Each time zone is counted at 15 º intervals and extends 7½º either side of a central meridian. ",
        "Each time zone is 15 degrees of longitude wide (with local variations) and the local time is one hour earlier than the zone immediately to the east on the map. The number of standard time zones is debatable and discussed among various sources, particularly with regards to the International Date Line. How Time Zones Work. Each time zone is then theoretically 15 degrees wide, corresponding to a one-hour difference in mean solar time. The shape of time zones is changed, in practice, to match internal and international borders."

Its job is to store and supply the cell with needed energy. ATP is found in the cytoplasm of the cell. The cytoplasm is the gel-type filler of the cell where all of the organelles of the cell hang out.
