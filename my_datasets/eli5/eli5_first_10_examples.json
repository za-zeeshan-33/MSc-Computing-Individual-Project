    "answer": "Yes. Did you watch The Social Network? They went a while before introducing ads, so they could make money, as they needed to establish their brand and amass users. Once you have dedicated users, introducing ads won't deter most, but if you are still new, having ads will deter a lot. The same goes for Uber, it's not that they aren't making money, it's that they are reinvesting a ton of it to make their service better.",

Python, Blackadder, Ab Fab, Mighty Boosh, etc.  There are obviously many euphemisms unique to (British) English vs American, and over the years i have (i think) figured most out.  The one area i can not seem to understand from context is education.  \"A levels\", \"0 levels\", \"6th form\", \"uni\" (yes, i know uni is university, but here university and college are interchangable).  Can a Brit help a Yank out?  Also, shilling, pence, pound, quid, etc. can you explain the monetary terminology? are they slang or is it more complicated than 100 pence to the pound?  And do Brits find the equivalent American systems as confusing?",
    "answer": "**Education:**\n\nProgression is measured in Years. Start in Year 1 and finish school in Year 13. I think these are the same as grades. \n\nThese are grouped in Key Stages (KS). Years 1 and 2 are KS1. Here you would go to an infant school.\n\nYears 3 to 6 are KS2. Here you would transfer to a junior or primary school. \n\nYears 7-9 are KS3. Here you would transfer to a secondary school. Secondary schools also teach years 10 and 11, and some or most have a sixth form for Years 12 and 13.\n\nYears 10 and 11 are when you do GCSEs. Most people do about 10 different subjects. The old name for GCSEs was \"O-levels\". Year 11 is also the end of compulsory education.  \n\nYears 12 and 13 are when you enter sixth form. In sixth form, you get your A levels. Most people do 3 A levels, and progress to university. University will likely have an entry requirement, say AAB, this means you need two A grades and a B grade in your subjects in A level.\n\nCollege here tends to refer to a vocational school, as an alternative to A levels after compulsory education. If you want to be a plumber or mechanic, then you would go to a college. \n\n\n**Money:**  \n\nShilling is old money. I have no idea how much a shilling is worth, and I've never seen one. My grandparents are probably familiar with them though.  \npound = dollar  \nquid = buck  \npence = cent  \n100 pence in a pound\n\n\n > And do Brits find the equivalent American systems as confusing?\n\nPersonally, yes. I don't really know what middle school and high school is. I didn't know that college and university meant the same thing, and \"valedictorian\" sounds like a fancy librarian.

As mentioned earlier, compressing a WAV file with zip doesn't shave much off the file size, which is why psychoacoustics are employed. However, the MP3 encoding process actually does employ the classic Huffman encoding algorithm. After all psychoacoustic methods have been applied, the Huffman encoding pass seeks out and compresses any remaining redundancies in the bit pattern. It's as though zip-type encoding were being run internally on the psychoacoustically encoded data.",
