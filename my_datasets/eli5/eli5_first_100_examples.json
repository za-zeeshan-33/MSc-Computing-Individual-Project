Once you have dedicated users, introducing ads won't deter most, but if you are still new, having ads will deter a lot. The same goes for Uber, it's not that they aren't making money, it's that they are reinvesting a ton of it to make their service better.",

Python, Blackadder, Ab Fab, Mighty Boosh, etc.  There are obviously many euphemisms unique to (British) English vs American, and over the years i have (i think) figured most out.  The one area i can not seem to understand from context is education.  \"A levels\", \"0 levels\", \"6th form\", \"uni\" (yes, i know uni is university, but here university and college are interchangable).  Can a Brit help a Yank out?  Also, shilling, pence, pound, quid, etc. can you explain the monetary terminology? are they slang or is it more complicated than 100 pence to the pound?  And do Brits find the equivalent American systems as confusing?",
    "answer": "**Education:**\n\nProgression is measured in Years. Start in Year 1 and finish school in Year 13. I think these are the same as grades. \n\nThese are grouped in Key Stages (KS). Years 1 and 2 are KS1. Here you would go to an infant school.\n\nYears 3 to 6 are KS2. Here you would transfer to a junior or primary school. \n\nYears 7-9 are KS3. Here you would transfer to a secondary school. Secondary schools also teach years 10 and 11, and some or most have a sixth form for Years 12 and 13.\n\nYears 10 and 11 are when you do GCSEs. Most people do about 10 different subjects. The old name for GCSEs was \"O-levels\". Year 11 is also the end of compulsory education.  \n\nYears 12 and 13 are when you enter sixth form. In sixth form, you get your A levels. Most people do 3 A levels, and progress to university. University will likely have an entry requirement, say AAB, this means you need two A grades and a B grade in your subjects in A level.\n\nCollege here tends to refer to a vocational school, as an alternative to A levels after compulsory education. If you want to be a plumber or mechanic, then you would go to a college. \n\n\n**Money:**  \n\nShilling is old money. I have no idea how much a shilling is worth, and I've never seen one. My grandparents are probably familiar with them though.  \npound = dollar  \nquid = buck  \npence = cent  \n100 pence in a pound\n\n\n > And do Brits find the equivalent American systems as confusing?\n\nPersonally, yes. I don't really know what middle school and high school is. I didn't know that college and university meant the same thing, and \"valedictorian\" sounds like a fancy librarian.

In a boiling water reactor, water heated by nuclear fission boils and turns into steam which powers a generator. The steam is then turned back into water by a condenser and used again. The most common type of nuclear power reactor is a pressurised water reactor. In a pressurised water reactor, hot pressurised water from the reactor's core boils water in a separate circuit, making steam that",

    "question_ctx": "[removed]",
    "answer": "I would attribute it to the ability to play well with others, as in the base for their products. Let me explain: Apple, for the most part, creates their own hardware and software for all their products. While they do allow apps from 3rd party companies, they limit the number of permissions to their iPhones and iPads in order to keep them a \"closed\" system, and since Siri is a part of that software package, developers don't get to have as much cooperation with Siri as the Google Assistant, Alexa, or even Cortana. Also, if you look at the companies that design these assistants, they all admittedly have different goals and methods of getting to those goals. Siri was created as a voice assistant for iOS and related products, and that's it. Google Assistant was created by a company that also has the most popular search engine in the world AND created an open source OS for mobile phones and tablets, thus opening up the uses for Google Assistant and its knowledge pool. Alexa was created by the world's largest online retailer, which dabbles in devices that run on the same open source OS as a standard Android phone, plus they have developed a partnership with Microsoft that allows them to allow Cortana and Alexa to talk to each other, meaning that they have a link to one of the world's largest software companies and their knowledge base on making a voice assistant.\n\nTL;DR: Siri is not as advanced as Alexa, Google, or even Cortana due to Apple's tendency to keep everything in house, as opposed to the partnerships and knowledge bases created by Google (Alphabet, if you're being technical), Microsoft and Amazon.",

    "answer": "Its a stereotype that has its roots in the slave era of America, kind of like chicken, chitlins, and hogs feet. As badly as the slaves were treated, they still had a community within themselves. Within this community they relied on the food that was plentiful for them, ie chcken, hogs feet, chitlins, watermelon. It grew plentifully, and as slavery ended the slave culture went away the image of watermelon and black remained. In the early 1900s til about the 30s, black culture was still openly depicted pretty harshly, with the big lips, extremely black frizzy hair kids, fat old mama/maid. Look at \"Little Black Sambo\" and also look at old cartoons from the 20's and 30's. The watermelon thing is just another one of those hold over from a different time, at this point its just a stereotype that just wont die, although there is still truth to it",

    "question": "How does a helicopter work?  Does it make sense that the propellers have enough lift to lift a helicopter?",
    "question_ctx": "My friend is saying that it is \"psuedo science\" how helicopters work.  From what I gather, he is saying that \"no one knows\" how a helicopter can have that much lift to lift a helicopter.\n\nIs he full of shit?  Can you explain to me, AND the lift... all the numbers/proof you could give me I would appreciate it.",
    "answer": "Your friend should stop publicly evaluating the merit of confirmed engineering practices until he can learn to open a book. Thousands of aerospace and aeronautical engineers aren't just guessing at the basic principles of lift here. I'm a fixed-wing pilot, so if any rotary guys are hanging out feel free to jump in and add/correct.\n\n\n\nA helicopter, or any wing, is more than capable of creating lift based on the shape and speed of the wing, or for a helicopter, rotors. Pilots call helicopters \"Rotary Wing\" aircraft because that is what they are. To understand the really massive amount of force pushing the helicopter's wings up, you need to think about the shape of that wing and the speed it is traveling at. \n\n*****\n\nIf you run a string along the top of a wing or rotor, that string will be longer than if you run it across the bottom of the wing. The air the wing is cutting through though is initially meeting the front of the wing at the same speed, whether it goes over the top or the bottom. Because the air has a longer path to travel over the top, it becomes less compacted, creating an area of lower relative pressure than the air passing beneath it. Imagine two lines of ants walking 5mph around a wing shaped divider. The ones walking in the straight line get to the other side faster than the ones walking around the curved side. This pressure differential generates, at high speed, what we call \"lift\" and pushes the helicopter into the sky. \n\n\n\nFrom there it is just math to make the jump from a little push to a big push, especially once you get to the high speeds a helicopter's engine pushes those rotors up to. If you consider that when you spin a wheel, a point on the outside is travelling a farther distance (circumference) in the same amount of time (1 revolution) as a point on the inside of the wheel, you see how the speed of the air passing over the wing gets very very large as you move out to the ends of the rotors. \n\n\n\nWith that kind of lift force, it is easy to see how the main rotor provides both the force to go up, as well as the force to go forward when the rotor is angled forward. \n\n*****\n\nI understand that this is perhaps not as simple as it should be for an ELI5, but I hope it at least helps you refute your friend. The best simple response to him is that a helicopter is not magic, it simply has two very fast wings travelling in rotation, as opposed to straight, hence its ability to force itself straight up into the sky.",

I'm hoping someone here has a simple/straightforward answer to how this works!\n\nI foster kittens. My current litter of two will be turning 6-weeks on Tuesday. I'm afflicted with depression and usually my meds are enough to keep it under wraps, but I had a meltdown tonight. Somehow, the kittens knew enough to immediately get up from their nap, seek me out (when normally they hit up their food or litter box first), beg for my attention, and then curl up in my lap, lick my knuckles, actively watch me, and purr. They like me and all, but such a sudden demand to be near me and such outward showings of affection has never happened before.\n\nWhile that's all fine and dandy, yay for sweet baby animals, I suppose my question is more specifically this: **how would five-week-old kittens understand human distress enough to immediately go to them/comfort them?** At that young and with their life experience, they couldn't have possibly experienced a human crying before, or possibly understand why. \n\nWhat's the science behind this stuff?\n\nEdit: Aaaaand, like a doofus, didn't tag the title.",

Australian pounds, shillings and pence were used to facilitate trade, much as they were being used in Britain.

    "answer": "You're misinterpreting the meaning of his principle. It's not a theory per se, it's a set of inequalities that assert limits to the precision by which pairs of complimentary variables of a particle can be known. This is not to be confused with the observer effect, which states that measuring a system affects it. In fact, Heisenberg's uncertainty explains the observer effect. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a fundamental property of quantum systems, and thus our physics are founded on it.\n\nSo in that capacity, yes, we observe it all the time when working in quantum systems. In fact, some quantum technologies are based upon it, including aspects of quantum computers, super conductors, quantum optics, and gravitational wave interferometers.\n\nLastly, never say \"just a theory\" again, it trivializes the underpinnings of all science. Newton rolls in his grave and spontaneously combusts in protest. Theories are not hypothesis, they are not educated guesses, they are not unfounded - theories explain facts and their relations, and are thus a higher order of knowledge than facts. Our most fundamental theories are validated by decades and centuries of independent proof. No one questions gravity or germ theory.",

That's it. Say you're looking for bands to sign, which will lead to their music being mass produced and shoved down throats far and wide. Ok, so say you go to a couple of concerts by some local bands and at the first concert you find the band to be incredible. They're obviously skilled musicians, incentive songwriting, just really good unique stuff, BUT, there's not many people in the crowd. Maybe they'd just starting out or they don't promote on social media or something. The second band you go to see is much worse. They aren't very skilled, and half the song is prerecorded and being played through the PA system. You don't enjoy this band, BUT, the place is packed and they obviously have a lot of friends and a social media presence. Now, since your job is to make money, you're going to sign the band that sells the most tickets. They're the most popular and thus will be a better investment financially. Now I'm on the other side of the country and don't really have a way to listen to either of these bands until one gets signed and their music gets mass produced and they go on tour. So the band that I get to hear is the one that was the most profitable. The music had nothing to do with it from your perspective. Does that sound good for me or other listeners out there?\n\n\n\nAlso, in pop music, many of the artists are manufactured products. They're basically a mascot that dances around while the music plays. There's some good singers out there, but they're not typically the ones writing, recording, and playing the music. There's tons of people involved in the creation of a single track, from recording engineers, multiple songwriters, producers, and studio music and whose names you'll never hear. No, apparently we want someone physically attractive that can dance to help us enjoy the music more. But why is this bad if people enjoy it? Well, for kind of the same reason as the other thing: it keeps us from hearing other stuff that was created through passion for playing and songwriting. The production company wants to make money. They aren't interested in highlighting talent and showcasing new acts. So again, it becomes more difficult to find new stuff that you might like because everything is saturated with the soup of the day. You know how some people often say \"music sucks nowadays...\"? Well, there's plenty of great new stuff out there, it's just being buried by the piles and piles of profitable stuff. Think of it like a popular Reddit thread. If you came late but made an awesome, funny comment, it's never going to see the light of day because it'll be buried in other comments. There's probably the best music you've ever heard being played in someones garage or bedroom, but how will it ever get to us?\n\n\n\nAnyway, I'm sure there's plenty of other, more specific examples, but these are just some general thoughts I had.",

Lol my boyfriend says he gets the same feeling when he \"has to deuce and it pushes on his prostate\" LOL. Can someone help me understand? ",
    "answer": "This was actually answered in the controversial book \"50 Shades of Grey.\" The clitoris is actually much bigger than the \"head\" that sticks out under the hood between the labia. The bladder, when full, can be touching the part of the clitoris that is farther back in the body. You can actually have stronger orgasms by not using the restroom before you engage in sexual activity for the same reason: stimulation of more of the clitoris.\nAs for your boyfriend, he's basically right. The prostate has a lot of nerve endings and the moving past of the excrement can rub against it giving a feeling of pleasure/arousal.\nFor more answers, I suggest two youtube channels: sexplanations (with Dr Doe) and sex+ (with Laci Green). The first is much more medically focused while the latter incorporates psychology and more \"practical\" advice.",

    "answer": "The human body is incredibly durable and much stronger than we normally assume, this is because when we're calmly exerting ourselves (like in the gym) we're aware of the stress the load puts on our body, and as such we are cautious to avoid injury.  With massive amounts of adrenaline that awareness fades to the background. It allows a person to use the upper limit of their capabilities, possibly damaging themselves in the process. Another factor is just how much was needed. Most people picture superman lifting the car over his head, when in reality even a fraction of an inch can give the needed escape room to survive.",

OP is asking about *states* not the federal government.  49 states have a bicameral legislature.   The main differences between the two houses are usually slight.  Usually the members in the upper house will have longer terms between elections and bigger districts, and few other differences.   So the main benefit comes from the mere *fact* that laws have to pass through two different bodies of people, who don't owe each other a damn thing.   It's not uncommon in legislative bodies from time to time to have a powerful party leader or committee chairman who is crazy, corrupt and/or stupid and gets crazy stuff passed through their house without argument.  But having to do the whole thing over again with a completely different set of people makes it more likely that the craziest stuff will simply not pass a second time.  Think of it like recessive mutant disease-causing genes: unless both your parents have the same bad gene, you're still safe.  [Source: I have worked on this kind of thing professionally.]",

    "answer": "Yeah. It's a bit of a mind fuck. Quantum mechanics is one of these fields that we can verify with experiments and math to very, very high levels of accuracy but the actual concepts don't compute in our squishy animal brains. It's always possible that there will come a new interpretation of the science that makes more sense, but this has been going on in quantum for about 100 years. Don't jump straight to \"WE CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE\". For many of these situations just because something seems to provide information faster than light it doesn't mean that an observer can get useful info out of it. Let's say that the photon \"knows the future\" a few nanoseconds ahead. Ok, but how long would it take for you to call someone on the other end of the experiment and tell them what you know? Even if you are as fast as the speed of light, you can't beat that other photon as it has a head start... So by the time you dial the other room and say \"THE GATE IS CLOSED\", it's already happened, you're not providing new info. This sort of thing is similar to entanglement thought experiments where two particles are sent to different states/planets/solar systems and changes to one affect the other. It's not really cheating.",

    "question": "If eating plant based diets is so much healthier, why do I not feel energized after eating salads, but much better after eating meats, cheeses, and fats?",
    "question_ctx": "I understand that vitamins and minerals are important, but I burn about 2000 calories, just through physical exertion at my job, according to my calculations. I eat relatively healthy, but don't see how I can maintain my level of activity by being a vegetarian.\n\nThe reason I ask, is because I have been trying to lessen my meat intake, but just can't exert myself like I do normally. For example, I had some pretty intense bloodwork done a few years ago. My diet was about 4 cups of coffee and a bagel with an egg, bacon and sausage with cheese for breakfast, a 12\" hoagie and 2 cups of coffee for lunch, and a large dinner of about 1500 calories. I thought I might have high blood pressure (due to everything I read about health), but turned out very healthy. No high blood pressure,  no high cholesterol, and even completely normal levels of WBC's of all types. \n\nI switched my diet considerably since then, and went through a period where I ate much less meat and subsequently lowered my fat intake, and felt terrible. Always sleepy, even with coffee, and not able to sleep at nights because I was so hungry, and I just could not get up anymore. I became borderline anemic, although I was still healthy. I also don't like eating veggies, but try to. \n\nCan someone who knows ALOT about nutrition explain what is going on, and why/how I should lower my meat intake?\n\nedit: coffee was for mental focus as well as helping me get out of bed and into the cold, dark world. I could not live without coffee.\n\nedit2: I decided to eat less meat for a few reasons. 1. It's expensive to buy good meat. I don't eat fast food, and humanely raised meat is twice as expensive as cheap feedlot meat. 2. I do think the world would be better off if we all ate less meat. 3.

The vast majority of First Nations who live on reserves were born on that reserve or one like it. Their friends, family, and co-workers are all there, and that reserve signifies a sense of cultural 'place'.\n\nMainstream Canadians have that sense of place too, but their impetus for residing in a place has more to do with the inherent economic opportunity than the cultural context. This is why places like Fort McMurray have strong population growth despite not a lot of people thinking it would be an otherwise highly desirable place to live.\n\nThis difference is was initially caused by and is presently being encouraged by the political ramifications of First Nations reserves with respect to the Indian Act. Reserves are not incorporated like mainstream Canadian municipalities, and their justification is primarily political as opposed to economic. This may not be the only, but certainly is a major factor in ensuring that First Nations stay on reserves and do not fully integrate into mainstream Canadian society like other minorities or immigrants.",

        "text": "say “goodbye,” it has to be one word. Goodnight as an Adjective The farewell “Good night” only applies when you’re using it as a greeting. Just because “goodnight” is not the right greeting does not mean it is useless when in writing. As a greeting, avoid using one word. But when used as a modifier both as an adjective (e.g. a hot meal, a thin cat) or noun-adjective (e.g. coffee cake, football player), it is appropriate to use goodnight. Take these sentences, for example: 1: I gave my daughter a good night kiss. 2: I gave my daughter a goodnight",
