    "answer": "Yes. Did you watch The Social Network? They went a while before introducing ads, so they could make money, as they needed to establish their brand and amass users. Once you have dedicated users, introducing ads won't deter most, but if you are still new, having ads will deter a lot. The same goes for Uber, it's not that they aren't making money, it's that they are reinvesting a ton of it to make their service better.",
