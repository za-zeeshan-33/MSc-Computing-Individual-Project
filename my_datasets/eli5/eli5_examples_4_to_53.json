    "question": "please explain American equivalents for British education terms (0 levels, 6th form, uni, etc)",
    "question_ctx": "I have always loved British comedy shows. Python, Blackadder, Ab Fab, Mighty Boosh, etc.  There are obviously many euphemisms unique to (British) English vs American, and over the years i have (i think) figured most out.  The one area i can not seem to understand from context is education.  \"A levels\", \"0 levels\", \"6th form\", \"uni\" (yes, i know uni is university, but here university and college are interchangable).  Can a Brit help a Yank out?  Also, shilling, pence, pound, quid, etc. can you explain the monetary terminology? are they slang or is it more complicated than 100 pence to the pound?  And do Brits find the equivalent American systems as confusing?",
    "answer": "**Education:**\n\nProgression is measured in Years. Start in Year 1 and finish school in Year 13. I think these are the same as grades. \n\nThese are grouped in Key Stages (KS). Years 1 and 2 are KS1. Here you would go to an infant school.\n\nYears 3 to 6 are KS2. Here you would transfer to a junior or primary school. \n\nYears 7-9 are KS3. Here you would transfer to a secondary school. Secondary schools also teach years 10 and 11, and some or most have a sixth form for Years 12 and 13.\n\nYears 10 and 11 are when you do GCSEs. Most people do about 10 different subjects. The old name for GCSEs was \"O-levels\". Year 11 is also the end of compulsory education.  \n\nYears 12 and 13 are when you enter sixth form. In sixth form, you get your A levels. Most people do 3 A levels, and progress to university. University will likely have an entry requirement, say AAB, this means you need two A grades and a B grade in your subjects in A level.\n\nCollege here tends to refer to a vocational school, as an alternative to A levels after compulsory education. If you want to be a plumber or mechanic, then you would go to a college. \n\n\n**Money:**  \n\nShilling is old money. I have no idea how much a shilling is worth, and I've never seen one. My grandparents are probably familiar with them though.  \npound = dollar  \nquid = buck  \npence = cent  \n100 pence in a pound\n\n\n > And do Brits find the equivalent American systems as confusing?\n\nPersonally, yes. I don't really know what middle school and high school is. I didn't know that college and university meant the same thing, and \"valedictorian\" sounds like a fancy librarian. Also I keep hearing about SATS.",

    "question_ctx": "[removed]",
    "answer": "I would attribute it to the ability to play well with others, as in the base for their products. Let me explain: Apple, for the most part, creates their own hardware and software for all their products. While they do allow apps from 3rd party companies, they limit the number of permissions to their iPhones and iPads in order to keep them a \"closed\" system, and since Siri is a part of that software package, developers don't get to have as much cooperation with Siri as the Google Assistant, Alexa, or even Cortana. Also, if you look at the companies that design these assistants, they all admittedly have different goals and methods of getting to those goals. Siri was created as a voice assistant for iOS and related products, and that's it. Google Assistant was created by a company that also has the most popular search engine in the world AND created an open source OS for mobile phones and tablets, thus opening up the uses for Google Assistant and its knowledge pool. Alexa was created by the world's largest online retailer, which dabbles in devices that run on the same open source OS as a standard Android phone, plus they have developed a partnership with Microsoft that allows them to allow Cortana and Alexa to talk to each other, meaning that they have a link to one of the world's largest software companies and their knowledge base on making a voice assistant.\n\nTL;DR: Siri is not as advanced as Alexa, Google, or even Cortana due to Apple's tendency to keep everything in house, as opposed to the partnerships and knowledge bases created by Google (Alphabet, if you're being technical), Microsoft and Amazon.",

It grew plentifully, and as slavery ended the slave culture went away the image of watermelon and black remained. In the early 1900s til about the 30s, black culture was still openly depicted pretty harshly, with the big lips, extremely black frizzy hair kids, fat old mama/maid.

    "question_ctx": "",
    "answer": "Because \"the public\" is a lot of people who want very different things, and there is no way to make everyone happy. The government just has to do the best it can.\n\nIf the government taxes the rich to implement social programs for the poor, the poor will be happy but the rich will be angry. If they cancel social programs to lower taxes, the rich will be happy but the poor will be angry.  \n\nIf they tighten gun regulations, then gun advocates will be angry. If they relax gun restrictions (or do nothing) then gun control advocates will be angry.  \n\nWhen same sex marriage was illegal, people who supported it were angry. When it was legalized the people rejoiced, and people who opposed it were angry.  \n\nThere is literally nothing the government can do that won't piss off *some* group of people. This is made even worse by confirmation bias. When the government does what we want, we tend to see that as the norm, what the government *should* be doing, so people tend to focus on the negatives, the things they don't like.",

    "question": "How does a helicopter work?  Does it make sense that the propellers have enough lift to lift a helicopter?",
    "question_ctx": "My friend is saying that it is \"psuedo science\" how helicopters work.  From what I gather, he is saying that \"no one knows\" how a helicopter can have that much lift to lift a helicopter.\n\nIs he full of shit?  Can you explain to me, AND the lift... all the numbers/proof you could give me I would appreciate it.",
    "answer": "Your friend should stop publicly evaluating the merit of confirmed engineering practices until he can learn to open a book. Thousands of aerospace and aeronautical engineers aren't just guessing at the basic principles of lift here. I'm a fixed-wing pilot, so if any rotary guys are hanging out feel free to jump in and add/correct.\n\n\n\nA helicopter, or any wing, is more than capable of creating lift based on the shape and speed of the wing, or for a helicopter, rotors. Pilots call helicopters \"Rotary Wing\" aircraft because that is what they are. To understand the really massive amount of force pushing the helicopter's wings up, you need to think about the shape of that wing and the speed it is traveling at. \n\n*****\n\nIf you run a string along the top of a wing or rotor, that string will be longer than if you run it across the bottom of the wing. The air the wing is cutting through though is initially meeting the front of the wing at the same speed, whether it goes over the top or the bottom. Because the air has a longer path to travel over the top, it becomes less compacted, creating an area of lower relative pressure than the air passing beneath it. Imagine two lines of ants walking 5mph around a wing shaped divider. The ones walking in the straight line get to the other side faster than the ones walking around the curved side. This pressure differential generates, at high speed, what we call \"lift\" and pushes the helicopter into the sky. \n\n\n\nFrom there it is just math to make the jump from a little push to a big push, especially once you get to the high speeds a helicopter's engine pushes those rotors up to. If you consider that when you spin a wheel, a point on the outside is travelling a farther distance (circumference) in the same amount of time (1 revolution) as a point on the inside of the wheel, you see how the speed of the air passing over the wing gets very very large as you move out to the ends of the rotors. \n\n\n\nWith that kind of lift force, it is easy to see how the main rotor provides both the force to go up, as well as the force to go forward when the rotor is angled forward. \n\n*****\n\nI understand that this is perhaps not as simple as it should be for an ELI5, but I hope it at least helps you refute your friend. The best simple response to him is that a helicopter is not magic, it simply has two very fast wings travelling in rotation, as opposed to straight, hence its ability to force itself straight up into the sky.",

Here are some of the most popular arguments made by pro-choicers and some tips on how to refute these arguments. 1) My body, my choice. This particular argument would be much more convincing if it really were the woman’s body.",

Somehow, the kittens knew enough to immediately get up from their nap, seek me out (when normally they hit up their food or litter box first), beg for my attention, and then curl up in my lap, lick my knuckles, actively watch me, and purr. They like me and all, but such a sudden demand to be near me and such outward showings of affection has never happened before.\n\nWhile that's all fine and dandy, yay for sweet baby animals, I suppose my question is more specifically this: **how would five-week-old kittens understand human distress enough to immediately go to them/comfort them?** At that young and with their life experience, they couldn't have possibly experienced a human crying before, or possibly understand why. \n\nWhat's the science behind this stuff?\n\nEdit: Aaaaand, like a doofus, didn't tag the title.",

    "answer": "You're misinterpreting the meaning of his principle. It's not a theory per se, it's a set of inequalities that assert limits to the precision by which pairs of complimentary variables of a particle can be known. This is not to be confused with the observer effect, which states that measuring a system affects it. In fact, Heisenberg's uncertainty explains the observer effect. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a fundamental property of quantum systems, and thus our physics are founded on it.\n\nSo in that capacity, yes, we observe it all the time when working in quantum systems. In fact, some quantum technologies are based upon it, including aspects of quantum computers, super conductors, quantum optics, and gravitational wave interferometers.\n\nLastly, never say \"just a theory\" again, it trivializes the underpinnings of all science. Newton rolls in his grave and spontaneously combusts in protest. Theories are not hypothesis, they are not educated guesses, they are not unfounded - theories explain facts and their relations, and are thus a higher order of knowledge than facts.
